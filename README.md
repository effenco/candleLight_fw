# candleLight_gsusb
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/candle-usb/candleLight_fw.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/candle-usb/candleLight_fw)

This is firmware for certain STM32F042x/STM32F072xB-based USB-CAN adapters, notably:
- ~~candleLight: https://github.com/HubertD/candleLight (STM32F072xB)~~
- ~~cantact: http://linklayer.github.io/cantact/ (STM32F042x6)~~
- ~~canable (cantact clone): http://canable.io/ (STM32F042x6)~~
- ~~USB2CAN: https://github.com/roboterclubaachen/usb2can (STM32F042x6)~~
- ~~CANAlyze: https://kkuchera.github.io/canalyze/ (STM32F042x6)~~

Of important note is that the common STM32F103 will NOT work with this firmware because its hardware cannot use both USB and CAN simultaneously.

This implements the interface of the mainline linux gs_usb kernel module and
works out-of-the-box with linux distros packaging this module, e.g. Ubuntu.

## Known issues

Be aware that there is a bug in the gs_usb module in linux<4.5 that can crash the kernel on device removal.

Here is a fixed version that should also work for older kernels:

The Firmware also implements WCID USB descriptors and thus can be used on recent Windows versions without installing a driver.

## Building

Building requires arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain.

```shell
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2019-q3-update.cmake

# or,
# cmake-gui ..
# don't forget to specify the cmake toolchain file before configuring.

make usbcan2eu_fw # one of candleLight_fw / usb2can_fw / cantact_fw / canalyze_fw / canable_fw / usbcan2eu_fw
# alternately, each board target may be disabled as cmake options

```

## Flashing

Flashing candleLight on linux: (source: [https://wiki.linklayer.com/index.php/CandleLightFirmware](https://wiki.linklayer.com/index.php/CandleLightFirmware))
- Flashing requires the dfu-util tool. On Ubuntu, this can be installed with `sudo apt install dfu-util`.
- compile as above, or download the current binary release: gsusb_cantact_8b2b2b4.bin
- Disconnect the USB connector from the CANtact, short the BOOT pins, then reconnect the USB connector. The device should enumerate as "STM32 BOOTLOADER".
- Flash the device with: `sudo dfu-util --dfuse-address -d 0483:df11 -c 1 -i 0 -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D CORRECT_FIRWARE.bin` where CORRECT_FIRWARE is the name of the desired .bin.
- Disconnect the USB connector, un-short the BOOT pins, and reconnect. The device is now flashed!
- If dfu-util fails due to permission issues on Linux, you may need additional udev rules. Consult your distro's documentation and see `70-candle-usb.rules` provided here.
